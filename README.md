This scripts allows users to share a minecraft server between different computers using a unique domain.
It includes Geyser too. (for crossplay with bedrock)

1. Open installation.bat for install google sync (to have the server folder synchronized with other computer) and the minecraft server jar.
2. Open start.bat for update the ip from your duckdns and start the minecraft server. (note: it will only open if the server is not online in other computer)

For more information about how to synchronize folders in Google Sync: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jlhl5T_21J8
Port 25565 must be open.
If you are using geyser, port 19132 must be open too.
